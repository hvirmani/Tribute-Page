                    <span>Background</span>
                    <p>Sachin Tendulkar was born to a brahmin family on 24 April, 1973 in Dadar, Mumbai. That is he belongs to renowned Saraswat Brahmin Family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi poet and novelist. His mother was Rajni who worked in the insurance industry. He has two half-brothers namely Nitin and Ajit and one half-sister Savita. His formative years were spent in the "Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society" in Bandra (East). He did his schooling from the Sharadashram Vidyamandir High School. In the school days, he attended the M.R.F.Pace Foundation to train himself to be a fast bowler. But as per the suggestion of Dennis Lillee, the fast bowler from Australia, he concentrated on batting. Sachin Tendulkar also likes playing tennis. At the age of 14, he scored 326 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match and became famous in Bombay schoolboys.</p>

                    <span>Career</span>
                    <p>Sachin is an aggressive batsman with flawless footwork and timing. Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score 329 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. A year later he scored a century on his first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became India’s youngest Test (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989. When he was 18 he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he scored 179 against the West Indies. In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s team.In 1996 World Cup, Tendulkar emerged as the tournament’s top run scorer, with 523 runs. India was defeated by Australia in the 1999 World Cup, failing to advance past the round of six, and was soundly defeated by both Australia and South Africa in series later that year. In the 2003 World Cup, however, Tendulkar helped his team advance as far as the finals.Tendulkar made history in December 2005 when he scored his record-breaking 35th century in Test play against Sri Lanka. The feat was accomplished in a total of 125 Tests and allowed Tendulkar to surpass the prolific Indian run scorer Sunil Gavaskar. In June 2007 Tendulkar reached another major milestone when he became the first player to record 15,000 runs in one-day international (ODI) play, and in November 2011 he became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test play. One month later he scored a historic “double century” in a contest against South Africa, becoming the first man in history to record 200 runs in a single innings of ODI play. He was named the 2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Cricketer of the Year. In an ODI match against Bangladesh in March 2012, Tendulkar scored his record-setting 100th international century—which included both Test (51 centuries) and ODI (49 centuries) play. He retired from ODI cricket later that year, and in 2013 he ended a six-year stint with the Indian Premier League (as a member of the Mumbai Indians) and retired from Test cricket, ending his playing days with records for the most career international runs (34,357) and Test runs (15,921). Throughout his long career Tendulkar was consistently ranked among the game’s best batsmen. He was often likened to Australia’s Don Bradman in his single-minded dedication to scoring runs and the certainty of his strokeplay off both front and back foot.</p>
